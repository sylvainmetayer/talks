Let's go back a few years...

August 2020, release of Terraform 0.13, your new project jumps on it and uses it!

June 2021, release of Terraform 1.0, just in time to deploy this new infra, perfect! For your old project, however, it's a breaking change: you'll have to install tfenv to manage the 2 versions...

April 2022, release of NodeJS 18, perfect for starting your side-project! Too bad for your old JS library, stuck in NodeJS 14, you'll have to install nvm to manage the 2 versions, more time to update...

Tired of having to install 50 different tools to change versions of node/java/terraform/... ?

Would you like to find a tool to manage all your tool versions in the same way, or even create your own plug-ins to manage your new tool versions?

Come and meet asdf, and let's see how it can help you on a daily basis!
